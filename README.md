## 🎯 What I Do

I build production systems that work for real people—especially those with complex needs. That comes from 7 years as a certified behavior analyst working with nonverbal autistic children, 18+ months running a production library system serving 200+ users, and now: designing the intersection of healthcare tech, responsible AI, and accessibility.

**Current:** CS degree at CU Denver (graduating May 2026) + active research in emergent AI behavior + 30-year visual artist

**Actively recruiting for:** Healthcare technology roles, accessibility engineering, backend infrastructure, AI systems design

## 🔬 Featured Research: Aurora

**Aurora** is an autonomous AI artist exploring creative behavior through behavioral learning—without explicit reward shaping.

[Full Research Documentation →](https://elijahsylar.github.io/aurora_ai/)

**Key Findings:**
- Removing prescriptive constraints improved output 15-25%
- Creative preferences emerged without predefined aesthetic rewards
- Natural contingency (seeing own output) drives behavior better than external optimization
- System remains interpretable (can observe reasoning via LLM)

**Publication Status:** White-paper ready, pursuing peer-reviewed publication with faculty mentor through EURēCA! Fellows summer program

**Why This Matters:**
- Demonstrates explainable AI approach (unlike black-box reward shaping)
- Applies behavioral psychology principles to machine learning
- Shows practical implementation of responsible AI
- Relevant to creative AI, HCI, cognitive science

**Tech:** PyTorch • Llama • Computer Vision • Behavioral Learning • Research Methodology

## 🎨 Why This Mix Matters

**Most backend engineers** can write code.  
**You** understand healthcare systems *and* can write the backend.

**Most AI researchers** work on papers.  
**You** built a running AI system that learns across 300+ sessions.

**Most developers** make accessible features as an afterthought.  
**You** have 4 years of professional accessibility experience—you know what it means to build for people who actually need it.

**Most CS students** build projects in isolation.  
**You** maintained production systems serving 200+ real users.

That combination is rare. Companies hiring for healthcare tech specifically value that.

## 💭 How I Think About Technology

Technology should:
- **Work for real people**, not just in theory
- **Be accessible** from day one, not bolted on
- **Respect human autonomy**, especially in creative/personal domains
- **Be maintainable**, because someone has to run it in production
- **Be honest**, which means explainability matters in AI

I've spent enough time with people who depend on technology working reliably and accessibly. That changes how you build.
