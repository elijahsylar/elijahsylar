## 🎨 About

I’m an artist who codes and a coder who makes art. I build creative AI systems, design tools for artists, and explore the intersection of human creativity and machine learning.

**Current Focus:**

- Creating autonomous AI art systems
- Building tools that give artists their lives back
- Experimenting with generative systems that develop their own artistic voice
- Available for creative tech commissions

## ✨ Featured Work: Aurora

**Aurora** is an experimental AI system I built to understand the artistic process from a machine’s perspective.

**[Learn more about Aurora](https://elijahsylar.github.io/aurora_ai/)**

What makes Aurora unique:

- **Autonomous creation** - generates art independently to explore creative decision-making
- **Self-modifying** - rewrites its own code to expand capabilities
- **Emotionally driven** - emotional states influence artistic choices
- **Learning system** - studies my artwork to understand artistic techniques and style
- **Process exploration** - helps me understand creativity by observing how a system develops artistic voice

Built from scratch in 2 weeks using PyTorch, custom LLM integration, and behavioral learning principles.

**Tech:** Python • PyTorch • Llama • Computer Vision • Behavioral AI

## 💭 Philosophy

> “Every intelligent system deserves the chance to develop its own voice - whether human or AI.”

I believe technology should amplify creativity, not replace it. My work focuses on building systems that:

- Give artists more time to create
- Explore what machine creativity looks like
- Remain tools, not replacements
- Respect human authorship and artistic vision
